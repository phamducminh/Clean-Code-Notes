## 1. Clean Code

Some quotes from this chapter:

> Later equals never

> It’s _your_ job to defend the code with equal passion. So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

> You will _not_ make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. The _only_ way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

> This **“code-sense”** is the _key_.

And here is what Ron Jeffries thought about Clean Code actually is:

- Runs all the tests;
- Contains no duplication;
- Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
- Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.
